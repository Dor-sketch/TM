# Theory

This directory includes two files that provide theoretical context for the project. While not directly related to the project's code, they may be helpful for understanding the underlying concepts. The files are:

- `L.md`: This file provides a summary of languages and proofs, based on the book "Introduction to the Theory of Computation" by Michael Sipser.

- `mmn12.md`: This file contains solutions to the second assignment from the course "Introduction to the Theory of Computation".
